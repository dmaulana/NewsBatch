										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Former Inter goalkeepr Paolo Orlandoni has given his thoughts on the current Inter squad and on manager Simone Inzaghi, who he praised highly as a suitable coach for the team.</strong></p>
<p>Speaking to Italian news outlet SuperNews.it, via <a href="https://www.fcinternews.it/news/orlandoni-inzaghi-scelta-perfetta-per-linter-sono-sicuro-che-fara-bene/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>FCInterNews</strong></a>, the 49-year-old gave his appraisal of the quality of the current Nerazzurri squad as well as talking about his time with the club.</p>
<p>Orlandoni came through the youth ranks at the Nerazzurri although he was never able to establish a regular role for himself at the club and went out on loan at a number of clubs before moving to Reggina.</p>
<p>He eventually came back to Inter, however, returning from Piacenza in the summer of 2005 to become the third-choice keeper for his boyhood club.</p>
<p>Orlandoni has also worked as a goalkeeping coach with the Inter Primavera setup strengthening his connection to the club, though he is currently in the position with Sassuolo.</p>
<p>Orlandoni described the current Inter team as a &#8220;strong, well-rounded group, cemented by the work done in recent years and by coach Antonio Conte, who led Inter to win the Scudetto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This year some important sales were made,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but equally important players were signed. I think Simone Inzaghi&#8217;s appointment was very intelligent, because I think he is a coach with high potential, very empathetic, who knows how to make the team play well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Entrusting Inzaghi this group, in my opinion, was a perfect choice,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure that they will do well, they have a good sporting project behind them and I think they will carry it forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>On his own time at the club, Orlandoni said, &#8220;When I returned to Inter I found coach Roberto Mancini, with whom we won the Scudetto for two seasons. For this reason, I believe that the first decisive step forward of the Massimo Moratti era was made by Mancini.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued, &#8220;Then, in 2009, Jose Mourinho arrived. Thanks to an incredible group and a club that was building important things, we continued to conquer titles with the Portuguese coach, beating everyone along the way, winning three trophies in 2010, the treble year, above all the Champions League, the primary objective of President Moratti and all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many anecdotes,&#8221; Orlandoni said. &#8220;For me, I grew up in Inter and I was always cheering for those colours, being part of the squad was a dream. We were many guys, of many different nationalities, but with a common intent. A solid club can win every trophy available with a large and strong group.&#8221;</p>
